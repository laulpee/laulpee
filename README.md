- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @laulpee but you can also call me Paul! I've joined the GitHub community in May 2022 and been stoked ever since then to connect!

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
  - Data Analytics through the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate program on Coursea
  - Google Sheets, Python, and R through personal data projects I work on during my free time

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in:
  - Data Analytics (especially, in Sports)
  - Coding languages
  - Playing & watching soccer
  - Photography (@pauljunholee on IG!)

- ðŸ’¼ Career Background:
  - I graduated with my Bachelor's degree (2017) and Master's degree (2018) in Structural Engineering at UC San Diego
  - Ever since graduating, I worked for 3+ years as an aerospace-structural engineer for couple engineering companies in San Diego. I mainly worked as an aerospace engineer at Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), working on structural analysis for composite repairs on navy jets.
  - With the desire of pursuing sports data analytics, I decided to leave the engineering industry and now am currently working as a soccer data collection / quality control analyst at Pro Football Focus.
