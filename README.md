- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @laulpee but you can also call me Paul! I've joined the GitHub community in May 2022 and been stoked ever since then to connect with amazing people like you!

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
  - Data Analytics through the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate program on Coursea (estimated completion date: July 2022)
  - Programming with Python through the free and amazing CS50P online course taught by Professor David Malan
  - Google Sheets through personal data projects I work on during my free time

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in:
  - Data Analytics (especially, in Sports)
  - Software Tool Development
  - Google Sheets
  - Playing & watching soccer
  - Photography (@laulpeephotography on IG!)

- Career Background:
  - I graduated with my Bachelor's degree (2017) and Master's degree (2018) in Structural Engineering at UC San Diego
  - Ever since graduating, I worked for 3+ years as an aerospace-structural engineer for couple engineering companies in San Diego. At my most recent job, I worked as an aerospace engineer at Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), working on structural analysis for composite repairs on navy jets.
  - Working during the pandemic made me realize that maybe structural engineering might not be the career that I would enjoy the most, and so I quit my job to take a break while figuring out what my next career step can look like.
  - It's been a year and I think I found what I want to pursue: data analytics (especially in the sports industry)! With that in mind, I currently am working as a soccer data collection analyst at Pro Football Focus and I'm so stoked to see what's ahead of me!
